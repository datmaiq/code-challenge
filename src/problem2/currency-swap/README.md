# Currency Swap Project

![Demo Image](src/assets/background/demo.png)

## Overview

Welcome to the Currency Swap project! This coding challenge, created for Tech 99, demonstrates a feature to swap tokens with exchange rates. I developed this project to showcase my skills and passion for joining Tech 99.

### Token Swap Features

**1. Select Token via Modal:**

- Users can select tokens for the transaction through a modal. The modal will display a list of available tokens and allow users to choose from the list.

**2. Display Token Conversion Rate:**

- After selecting tokens, the system will show the conversion rate between the chosen tokens. The conversion rate will be updated instantly and clearly for easy tracking by the user.

**3. Swap Token:**

- When the user performs a swap, the number of tokens will be saved and updated in the system. The interface will display the amount of tokens swapped along with images of the token types.

**4. Get Help Link:**

- To provide additional support, a "Get Help" link will direct users to the [99tech](https://www.99tech.co/) website. This page offers useful information and guidance related to using the token swap application.
